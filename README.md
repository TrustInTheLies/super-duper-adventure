Basically, it's a first try on Vue, did a really bad job in terms of version controlling but well, at least at the end, lol, but back to business.

So, i could say it's okay for the first attempt, but it's mainly a landing page, there is not so much logic in here and for the most part it's primitive. What is more important, is that I've come to realize what could be done better, who knows, maybe I'll come back here later.
